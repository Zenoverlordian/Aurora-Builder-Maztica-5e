    <element name="Figurine of Wondrous Power, Onyx Orca" type="Magic Item" source="The Orca Folk" id="ID_JHNW_ANM3_MAGIC_ITEM_FIGURINE_OF_WONDROUS_POWER_ONYX_ORCA">
		<description>
			<p>This onyx statuette of an orca is about the size of a humanhand. Tossing down the figurine and uttering the commandword causes it to transform into a living "onyx orca." Thecreature obeys and serves its owner and has all the features ofa standard figurine of wondrous power.</p>
			<p>In addition to fighting at its owner's command, the onyxorca can be harnessed to pull a boat or raft at up to one halfits swim speed. It is also possible to ride on the orca, butdoing so requires a harness or rope or improvised hand holds.Hanging onto the back while the animal moves is extremelydifficult, requiring a DC 18 Dexterity check for each minute oftravel (or the rider falls off).</p>
			<p>A <em>figurine of wondrous power</em> is a statuette of a beast small enough to fit in a pocket. If you use an action to speak the command word and throw the figurine to a point on the ground within 60 feet of you, the figurine becomes a living creature. If the space where the creature would appear is occupied by other creatures or objects, or if there isn't enough space for the creature, the figurine doesn't become a creature.</p>
			<p class="indent">The creature is friendly to you and your companions. It understands your languages and obeys your spoken commands. If you issue no commands, the creature defends itself but takes no other actions.</p>
			<p class="indent">The creature exists for a duration specific to each figurine. At the end of the duration, the creature reverts to its figurine form. It reverts to a figurine early if it drops to 0 hit points or if you use an action to speak the command word again while touching it. When the creature becomes a figurine again, its property can't be used again until a certain amount of time has passed, as specified in the figurine's description.</p>
