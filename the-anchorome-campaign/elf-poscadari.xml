        <description>
            <p>The Poscadari elves are bronze skinned subrace of elves thatcame from the distant, snow covered north following a wiseand powerful shaman named Wanahton. Occasionally, in thecorrect light, a light blue tinge can be seen in their skin tone;an adaptive leftover from their past days as a people of thesnowy tundra.</p>
            <p class="indent">The different Poscadari tribes don't maintain differentphysical abilities like the Minnenewah, however they mostcertainly have different outlooks, particularly on foreigners.Some are cruel and violently xenophobic, while others can bewelcoming and even helpful if approached in a friendlymanner. Almost all are on good terms with the Azuposi withthe exception of the tribes from the eastern shore of Anchôromé.</p>
