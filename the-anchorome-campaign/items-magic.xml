			<p>Lesser talismans hold 6 "talisman points". Each day, a lesser talisman regains 1d6 of these points (up to its maximum). These talisman points can be used by a character who hasthe talismanic magic feature or has selected the feat to twistspells to suit their needs. Some of these alterations are taken from the sorcerer'smetamagic feature, but others are new. Not every talismancan use every form of metamagic and their capabilities are asunique as the talismans themselves. The classification oflesser or greater has no bearing on which metamagic featuresthe talisman gives a caster access too, thereby making itpossible to have a lesser talisman that is more versatile thanone that is greater. Depending on the wants and needs of acaster, this may make a lesser talisman more desirable.</p>
            <h5>Talisman Usage</h5>
            <p>A spellcaster who has the talismanic magic feature or whotakes the feat must attune to a particular talisman in order touse it. This is exactly like attuning to a magic item, but it doesnot count against that number of magic items the caster canattune to. Only one talisman may be attuned to at a time.</p>
            <p class="indent">Some of the metamagic features available to talismans andtheir users are from the sorcerer's metamagic feature andothers are new. Each comes with a cost in talisman points,which are subtracted from the talisman's total when used.</p>
            <p class="indent">Talismans give their attuned users access to metamagicfeatures as long as there are still talisman points available forthe day. If a talismanic magic user attempts to use ametamagic feature when there are too few or no talismanicpoints available, nothing special occurs beyond the normaleffects of the cast spell. Using a talisman to alter or enhance aspell is a bonus action and the attuned owner is always awareof how many talisman points remain in a talisman.</p>
            <p class="indent">Note that a talisman regains talisman points each dayregardless of whether or not its attuned owner has taken along rest. Clever talismanic magic casters who own two ormore talismans use this to their advantage by switchingattunements during a long rest to a talisman with moretalisman points.</p>

	<element name="Arrow of the Great Pine" type="Magic Item" source="The Anchorome Campaign" id="ID_JHSB_ANC1_MAGIC_ITEM_ARROW_GREAT_PINE">
		<description>
			<p>These arrows are one of the two items made and used byOglala (with the other being bracers of archery), perhaps thegreatest archer of all time among the Minnenewah.</p>
			<p class="indent">Oglala slew a massive giant, perhaps even the mate of thegiant of Junacolla with a number of these arrows, though hewas in turn slain by the very Thunderbird itself. Oglala grewfar too bold and thought himself powerful enough to hunt theGreat Spirit.</p>
			<p class="indent">Arrows of the great pine look like normal arrows, thoughthey are mildly flexible and holding one can cause hands tobecome sticky with sap. Once fired from a bow, the arrowsturn into a fully formed pine tree during mid flight whichcause 4d10 piercing damage on a successful hit.</p>
			<p class="indent">The arrows are found in bundles of 2d4 and once fired, theyremain in tree form and lose their magic.</p>
